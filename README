xgetc is command line tool to get geometry/color/position of the selection or
clicked location in X.

I was doing some web development and hated going back and forth between vim and
gimp color picker for getting the hexadecimal color of some random pixel on the
screen.  Googling returned nothing then so I tried to come up with my own program
but ended up copying most of the code from ImageMagick :o)

So most of the code in xgetc was shamelessly stolen^Wcopied ImageMagick.

Sample usage:

% xgetc -g   # click and drag anywhere on your screen, the geometry will be
             # printed.

% xgetc -c   # click anywhere on your screen, the color will be printed in hex,
             #  e.g. #3366ff.

% xgetc -p   # click anywhere on your screen, the mouseclick position will be
             # printed in hex.
